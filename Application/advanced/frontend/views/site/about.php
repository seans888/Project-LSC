<h2> Mission </h2>
<hr style ="margin-left: 270px; margin-right: 1000px;">

<div>
<p>Our mission is to enhance the intellectual development of students 
in the Philippines by augmenting the learning they receive from the 
educational system. We aim to accomplish this by providing the most 
comprehensive and highest quality tutorials and review services, 
maintaining competent and progressive teaching and support staff, 
continually updating our books and materials, and providing an 
environment conducive to learning and achievement. </p>
</div>

<h2> Vision </h2>
<hr style ="margin-left: 270px; margin-right: 1000px;">
<div>
<p>We aspire to become a center of educational excellence and a 
resource for sectors of our society deprived of opportunities for 
advance learning. We desire to see the students we help achieve their 
educational goals – from the simplest one of passing their school 
quizzes to developing their character and critical thinking skills - 
so that they may become successful members of society and contribute 
to the development of the country. </p>

<h2> History </h2>
<hr style ="margin-left: 270px; margin-right: 1000px;">
<div>
<p>In the early 1980’s, a group of faculty members from the University 
of the Philippines and the Ateneo de Manila University got together to 
provide tutorial services in their spare time to children of faculty 
and staff of the two universities. As more and more students from these 
and other schools availed of their services, some of these educators 
opted to undertake tutoring full-time. One of them established, 
in 1986, a tutorial and review facility at a strategic location on 
Katipunan Avenue. This became known as the Solomon’s Ark Computer & 
Tutorial Services Center. After 5 years, its name was changed to the 
Loyola Student Center. From a handful of students that year, LSC’s 
clientele has increased considerably. Over the past 23 years, LSC has 
helped over 22, 000 students perform better in school. Today LSC takes 
leadership in providing high-quality and affordable tutorial and review 
services to students not only in Metro Manila but also from the 
provinces.</p>

<h2> Working Principle </h2>
<hr style ="margin-left: 270px; margin-right: 1000px;">
<div>
<p>LSC was organized out of the founder’s desire to share the knowledge 
he had obtained as a working student and as a university instructor. 
Every member of the LSC staff and every student who enters its doors 
are reminded of the value of hard work with this passage from the Holy 
Bible.</p> 

<pre class = "p1">
“Whatever you do, work at it with all your heart as working for the Lord and not for men.” 
																	Colossians 3:23
</pre>
<p>This is the principle that guides all activities carried on at LSC.</p>
</div>

<h2> Outreach Programs </h2>
<hr style ="margin-left: 270px; margin-right: 1000px;">
<div>
<p>Every summer since 1999, LSC has served as the implementing partner 
of the Rotary Club of Loyola Heights in granting college entrance test 
review scholarships to selected fourth year students from poor families 
desiring to enter the top universities in Metro Manila. Several of these 
review scholars have not only made it to the universities of their 
choice but have even qualified for the scholarships offered by those 
schools. This is now the eleventh year that the Ford Foundation, 
through Ateneo’s Pathways to Higher Education Program, has chosen LSC 
to be its official college entrance test review center of the 120 
scholars that it selects yearly from depressed communities in Metro 
Manila. LSC has also extended its review programs to other students in
 need of financial assistance. </p>
